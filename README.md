# Address-Book-system
The Address Book System is a console-based application developed in C that allows users to efficiently store, manage, and retrieve contact information. The system is designed to simulate a real-world contact management solution using fundamental concepts of programming and data handling.
The application enables users to add new contacts, view all saved contacts, search for a specific contact, edit existing contact details, and delete contacts when they are no longer required. Each contact typically contains information such as name, phone number, email ID, and address.
To ensure data persistence, the Address Book System uses file handling, allowing contact details to be saved permanently and retrieved even after the program is closed and reopened. The project emphasizes structured programming by making extensive use of functions, structures, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.
This project helped strengthen understanding of core C programming concepts, logical thinking, and real-world problem solving. It also reflects practical skills required for entry-level software and embedded systems roles.
